This online self-learning course aims to provide basic knowledge about spatial datasets in R and how to analyse them. In many instances R might not be the fastest tool one can use for these kinds of analyses, but it certainly is the fastest in terms of time spent in code development. 
Apart from the [lecture slides](https://iiasa.ac.at) the course is structured into spatial data types and basic geospatial analyses. This course assumes that users already have basic knowledge of R.

I generally tried to avoid replicating things that are already openly available online through other resources. Thus, if you are interested in more or other training materials regarding spatial data and analyses, check out the resources link at the top with more examples and free self-learning tutorials.
